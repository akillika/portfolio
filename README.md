# Akil Sundararajan - Personal Website

A minimal, design-first personal website built as a quiet, intentional alternative to a traditional resume.

This site represents my work, thinking, and values - presented with restraint, clarity, and a subtle Tamizh cultural touch.

## ✦ Philosophy

- Design should feel calm, not loud  
- Systems should be reusable, not clever  
- Ownership matters more than assignment  
- Culture can be present without being performative  

This website intentionally avoids heavy visuals, animations, and gimmicks.

---

## ✦ Design Principles

- **Ultra-minimal, editorial layout**
- **White space as a primary design element**
- **Typography-led hierarchy**
- **Subtle Tamizh influence** through kolam patterns and micro-copy
- **English-first**, with optional Tamil context
- **Mobile-first, desktop-refined**

The goal was to build something that could remain relevant and unchanged for years.

## ✦ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- No backend
- No frameworks
- No external UI libraries

The site is intentionally simple and lightweight.

---

## ✦ Why this exists

LinkedIn increasingly requires login to view even basic profile information.

This website serves as:
- A public, accessible professional identity
- A design-driven resume
- A personal space that reflects how I think and build

---

## ✦ What this is not

- Not a portfolio gallery
- Not a marketing page
- Not an experiment playground

It’s meant to be **quiet, clear, and honest**.
